# About atm monemul haque

Hello!

Welcome to my profile site.

I am an artist having experience in graphic design, print production, web development and content creation. Earlier I served the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Bangladesh for more than 30 years. In order for better rendering of my services, I equipped myself with various training and workshops on photography, videography, printing and pre-press techniques.

I use with ease a number of design, DTP and multimedia tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere, Audition etc. apart from te tools used in web design and development such as Figma, Webflow, Github. I held a solo photo exhibition in Kolkata, India in June 2009. I have been awarded the best photographer from Bangladesh in the '1st International Color Slide Exhibition 1996' organized by 'AALOK Group of Photographers'. My photographic works have been published in a number of prestigious publications at home and abroad.
